## Announcements

### About Add-drop Period: Tomorrow at 3 pm the course will be open for all students who are on probation. Please find a section that is both empty and suits your schedule fully (in terms of both lecture hours and especially lab hours). We are not going to change your sections even if you mistakenly register and create a scheduling conflict. 

* Midterm date: **TBA**.
* Final date:  **6th of January 13:30**.
  
## Objectives

This course gives a brief introduction to a working understanding of basic computer organization, data representation, programming language constructs, and algorithmic thinking. It is designed as a first course of programming and supported by laboratory sessions for students outside of the Computer Engineering major.

## Textbook
*Programming with Python for Engineers,* by S. Kalkan, O. T. Şehitoğlu and G. Üçoluk. 
Available at: [https://pp4e-book.github.io/](https://pp4e-book.github.io/)

## Course Conduct

The flow of this course has 2 hours of in-class (theoretical) lectures + 2 hours of laboratory work. In addition, the theoretical part has Midterm and Final exams.

This has been altered as follows:

Weekly:

* In a pre-scheduled (see: Schedule section below) session, the lecturer will perform the subject review and a recitation (going over programming examples) of that week’s topics.
* Starting with the 4th week, there will be a lab session held at MM-14. Here the students will be given a programming  environment and a task that they will code in a given duration.

About Exams:

* Midterm exam and final exam will be in class.


## Course Material

* **_Course Textbook_**  [Available at: [https://pp4e-book.github.io/](https://pp4e-book.github.io/)]
  This is an 'interactive' book with a rather 'minimalist' approach: Some details or specialized subjects are not emphasized and instead, direct interaction with examples and problems are encouraged. Therefore, rather than being a 'complete reference manual', this book is a 'first things first' and 'hands on' book. The pointers to skipped details will be provided by links in the book. Bearing this in mind, the reader is strongly encouraged to read and interact <u>all</u> contents of the book thoroughly. 

  The book's interactivity is thanks to <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter notebook</a>. Therefore, the book differs from a conventional book by providing some dynamic content. This content can appear in audio-visual form as well as some applets (small applications) embedded in the book. It is also possible that the book asks the reader to complete/write a piece of Python program, run it, and inspect the result, from time to time. The reader is encouraged to complete these minor tasks. Such tasks and interactions are of great assistance in gaining acquaintance with Python and building up a self-confidence in solving problems with Python. 

  You can download the PDF of the course textbook from [https://pp4e-book.github.io/](https://pp4e-book.github.io/).

  Of course, the PDF does not provide the dynamic content. 

* **_Course Workbook_**  [Available at: [https://pp4e-workbook.github.io/](https://pp4e-workbook.github.io/)]
  This is also a Jupyter book that is coherent with the course textbook. It contains solved and unsolved exercises in Python which are tagged with difficulty levels [between ★ and ★★★★★]. Students are strongly advised to work, level by level, through the solved exercises then proceed to the unsolved ones.

* **_Python Interpreter_**

  There are two alternatives to practice Python:
  
  1. Installing a _Python 3 Interpreter_ on your personal computer.

  2. Using an interpreter accessible on the Web. 

     * This alternative is the environment the book is written on, i.e. Google Colab: <a href="https://colab.research.google.com"> https://colab.research.google.com</a>.
     
       <img src="https://github.com/sinankalkan/CENG240/blob/master/figures/colabEntryPage.png?raw=true" alt="gg" style="zoom:70%;" />

       After cancelling the entry page, you arrive at a page which looks like the one above. Click "+ Code" tab and you will see at the bottom a freshly created cell. You can type in that cell your Python code and run it by hitting the small arrow  <img src="https://github.com/sinankalkan/CENG240/blob/master/figures/rightarrowincircle.png?raw=true" alt="gg" style="zoom:50%;" />  at the left top of that cell. 

     * Another alternative is to use another online interpreter:
